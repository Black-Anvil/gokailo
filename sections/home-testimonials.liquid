                                    they say). I've tried physical therapy, acupuncture, cryotherapy, several nerve
                                    pills but the only thing up until Kailo that helped cut the pain was Oxy. I've been
                                    wearing two Kailo patches now for about 2 months and haven't taken a pain pill the
                                    entire time. THANK YOU KAILO!"

                                    visits and tests, it became very frustrating. We have found it to help with
