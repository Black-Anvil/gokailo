And helps the </span><a href="https://cdn.ps.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/09/300915_Transmission-of-pain-signals-to-the-brain.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brain better communicate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with painful areas of the body more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a runner, hiker, or perhaps even a </span><a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/advice/g495/small-garden-ideas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardener</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The knee is a weight-bearing synovial joint that we're constantly using daily for flexion and extension movements. Meaning it is susceptible to all sorts of injuries or overuse issues. Be it from sports, hobbies, day-to-day living, or even obesity.</span></p>
<h2><b>How can the Kailo pain patch help me with my knee pain?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successfully proven and drug-free alternative to knee pain relief medication is to place a Kailo pain patch horizontally just above the knee. By keeping one edge of the patch on the center of the knee, continue wrapping the rest around the outer side of your leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each patch has millions of nanocapacitors that act as bio antennas. Which helps improve the communication between your brain and the location of the pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As each patch is reusable, keep moving the patch up along the nervous system pathway towards the brain. You'll know it's starting to work when the pain relief patch starts to give off a warm, tingling sensation. And it may begin to relieve you from your discomfort in seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By playing around with the placement, you may be able to alleviate the knee pain very quickly, allowing you to continue enjoying your outdoor pursuit. The Kailo patch may also assist you by offering lower back pain relief.</span></p>
<h2><b>Make use of the Kailo KT tape to assist with knee pain.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider combining it with </span><a href="https://gokailo.com/collections/all-pain-patches/products/kailo-kt-tape"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kailo KT tape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It comes in a pack of 30 adhesives, measuring 1.2'' x 3.5''. It's very soft on the skin, simple to use, and the best part is it won't pull out hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinically tested and designed, the KT tape helps keep your Kailo pain patch in place around ankles, wrists, arms, and knees. Areas of the body that move a lot or are hard to reach, giving you better peace of mind and allowing the Kailo pain relief patch to potentially speed up your recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each piece of KT tape will last between one to three days, depending on the placement location and your skin type. And when the adhesive loses its stick, peel the adhesive tape off and put on the new one.</span></p>
