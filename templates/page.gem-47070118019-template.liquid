<h1>Kailo Pain Patch Placement Guide for Fast Relief</h1>
<p>Instead of placing Kailo on top of the location that hurts, start by placing Kailo a few inches away from the pain—between the pain and your brain along the nervous system pathway. Hold the Kailo in place for a few moments to see if you can feel it start to slightly warm up. If Kailo warms up, it’s already beginning to work. Even if Kailo doesn’t warm up, you should feel Kailo start to work in less than a minute. If pain doesn’t subside, slowly move Kailo a few inches and try again. When you find the right spot, you’ll notice a significant decrease or even elimination of your pain. If your pain was caused by an injury, following the same placement process between the injury location and the brain is often an effective solution.</p>
<p>Kailo is an innovative, non-transdermal technology that looks and acts like a patch. Kailo can be placed directly on the skin, or over lightweight clothing or placement accessories. Kailo does not have to touch the skin to be effective.</p>

<h2>Head</h2>
<p>For headaches originating in the forehead, place Kailo horizontally over one temple and one half of the forehead. If your pain is behind the eye, Place Kailo vertically covering your forehead and eye. For headaches originating at the base of the skull, place Kailo horizontally over the Inion (the projecting part of the occipital bone at the base of the skull).</p>

<h2>Shoulder</h2>
<p>Start by placing Kailo vertically along the trapezius muscle, starting near the end of the shoulder. Slowly move the Kailo across the trapezius muscle toward the neck, pausing periodically until the best location is found. Alternatively, use the Kailo in the same manner over the pectorals from shoulder to neck.</p>

<h2>Hand and Elbow</h2>

<h2>Knee</h2>

<h2>Using Kailo Adhesive</h2>
<p>Each Kailo comes with a small pack of adhesives that can be easily applied to the back of your Kailo for seamless application. When the adhesive loses its stick, simply peel it off and apply a new one for next time. If you don’t want to use the provided adhesives, feel free to use your favorite athletic or medical tape to hold your Kailo in place.</p>
<p>Instructions: Start by aligning the adhesive (print side down) with the back of the Kailo. Hold down on one end while you remove the adhesive backing on the other end. Once one end has been applied, remove the backing on the other end to finish adhesive installation. The Kailo can now be stored like this until ready to use.</p>
<p>Once ready to use, simply remove the clear adhesive backing from the Kailo and apply to your skin or clothing!</p>
<p>We've found that a Kailo with our adhesive backing can be removed and reapplied to your skin multiple times before losing its stick. When the adhesive loses its stick, wash it gently with soap and water to renew its stickiness. If that doesn't work, simply peel the adhesive off and put on a new one as shown.</p>

<h1>Duration of Use</h1>
<p>Use Kailo day-in and day-out for best results. You can apply Kailo with the included adhesive patches and wear Kailo while awake, while sleeping, and even while bathing. The Adhesives last as long as 7 days depending on placement and skin type and can even be cleaned with mild soap and water to extend their effectiveness. After the adhesive patches no longer stick, they can simply be removed, discarded, and replaced with a new one. The Kailo patch is very durable. Treated properly, Kailo may last for years before needing replacement. Kailo is a great value. No other pain relief on the market offers so much potential for a one-time purchase.</p>
