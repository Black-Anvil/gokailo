<p><a href="https://gokailo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the brand name for a lower back pain relief patch that most people have grown attached to, thanks to its healing effects. Knowing how to place the patch and how often they should wear it can be confusing for a first-time user. The good news is one can wear the lower back </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313958320_Topical_patches_as_treatments_for_the_management_of_patient_musculoskeletal_and_neuropathic_pain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pain relief patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for as long as they want. If you are a first-time user, you likely wonder if you can wear two or more Kailos simultaneously. Here is what you need to know:</span></p>
<h2><b>The science behind Kailo patch</b></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo is a pain relief patch that signals the body to fight against the pain it is experiencing. Its technology does not rely on a plug-in or battery to trigger the body's electric flow. Instead, it signals the brain to negotiate with the injured part to reduce the pain. Kailo depends on the following technologies to help reduce pain:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bio-identification- The patch interacts with the body's natural receptors that conduct negotiations between neurotransmitters and the brain. The ongoing negotiation may result in pain relief depending on where the pain is. Unlike other </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/N22-029S012-Methyl-salicylate-Clinical-2-PREA.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pain relief patches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kailo relies on natural signals, not other chemicals.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Effective signal transmission- Kailo's technology relies on signal transmission from the brain to other parts of the body experiencing pain. It helps the brain to communicate with the affected body part to relax.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can wear two Kailo pain patches at once. And many people even wear three or more. When wearing multiple Kailo’s be aware that the effects of each may be lowered. We suggest trying to add one at a time, see how the pain management feels and go from there. </span></p>
