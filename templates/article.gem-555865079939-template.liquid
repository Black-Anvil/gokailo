<p><b>How to Use a Pain Patch?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Kailo pain patch can be placed on any area of the body above where you are experiencing pain. You'll then need to move the patch along the pathways in your nervous system towards your brain until you find the location that works best to relieve your pain. Kailo patches have an adhesive backing that allows them to be stuck to your skin.</span></p>
<p><b>The Benefits of Using a Pain Patch</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kailo pain patch uses innovative technology to help reduce or eliminate pain. It's flexible and can be worn comfortably throughout the day. The patch is also reusable and can be used many times before it loses its stick. You'll also be able to replace the adhesive once it's no longer sticky.</span></p>
