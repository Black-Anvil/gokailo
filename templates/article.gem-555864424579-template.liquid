<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acute and chronic pain management has primarily focused on medications that work to minimize or reduce pain levels. Unfortunately, these medications come with some serious side effects. When someone is suffering chronic pain such as that associated with lower back pain, these medications can result in some significant complications that could be life-threatening or create a life-long </span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/rxreportfinalprint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kailo has developed a natural, non-pharmaceutical-based solution that is free of side effects.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Side-Effects of Pain Management Medications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The side effects of pain main management medications are well-documented, ranging from nausea and vomiting to toxicity and organ damage, which over time can become life-threatening. Until recently, it has been a no-win situation for those suffering lower back pain as the medications are necessary for daily functioning. Still, with no effective alternatives, the patient suffers the risk of a serious side effect.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Evolution of Pain Management</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of a Kailo, a non-medication-based means of pain management, represents the dawn of a new era. The topical pain management patch may offer lower back pain relief by providing an alternative, especially in light of the exceedingly positive results in clinical trials to date.</span></p>
<h3><b>No Side Effects</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using patented nanotechnology that works to boost the body's natural signals and enable the brain to communicate more effectively with the disrupted area, the pain management patch is devoid of side effects. This means those with chronic conditions such as lower back pain will no longer have to suffer the </span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/rxreportfinalprint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debilitating side effects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with the oral medications traditionally prescribed to manage pain.</span></p>
<h3><b>No Systemic Impact</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the analgesic effect is delivered without systemic involvement, the risk of dependency or addiction is not a factor, nor is the risk of the medication causing toxicity, which can </span><a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/painmeds_analgesics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage the </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">body's different organs and become life-threatening with continued use.</span></p>
<a href="https://gokailo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo is a pain patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offers real hope to those suffering from chronic pain. It is one of the few non-medication-based options for lower back pain relief on the market today.</span></div></div>
