<div data-label="Text Block"> <div class="elm text-edit"><div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0121/1537/8238/files/pexels-ivan-samkov-4240503_480x480.jpg?v=1626825403" alt="pain relief patch" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left;" width="480x480" height="480x480"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2020 may have ushered in the dawn of Zoom conference calls and the new work-from-home era, the reality is that for most office to remote worker converts, they're still desk-bound for the best part of eight hours a day â€” sometimes even longer as many employees are now finding with this new way of working. It continues to mean that for some, lower back and neck discomfort from sitting for long periods has not gone away but instead become exacerbated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step in </span><a href="https://gokailo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nanotechnology pain patch designed to boost the natural signals of the body. And help the brain communicate with disrupted areas more effectively.</span></p>
<h2><b>How does it work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo is a pain relief patch that, among other pain, may potentially assist you with neck and lower back pain relief. Each patch sticks to your body with a silicone adhesive strip. It's also water-proof and reusable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specially designed, Kailo's pain patch relies on millions of little nano-capacitors that act as bio antennas. These send signals to help the brain identify and clarify the specific point of the pain in the body. And better communicate this through the pathways within the nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The placement of the Kailo pain relief patch is crucial as this may help speed up your recovery. And potentially offer you some much-needed lower back pain relief.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0121/1537/8238/files/Kailo_DoYouSit_Infographic-01_480x480.jpg?v=1626825503" alt="lower back pain relief" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the best results, place the patch just above the source of your pain. When it comes to lower back pain, place it horizontally just above the lumbar spine, where the thoracic spine starts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then slowly but surely, start moving the Kailo pain patch away from the initial source of pain, moving it in an upwards direction towards the brain. Following the natural route of your nervous system, as it sends signals and communicates with the brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll know it's starting to work when you feel the Kailo pain relief patch begin to warm up and tingle. And you may be just seconds away from lower back pain relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is not to give up and to keep trying different patch placement points. Begin near to and just above your source of pain and work around this region to help speed up your recovery and eliminate it.</span></p>

And potentially be on your way to overcoming your desk-bound discomfort, leaving your body pain-free to put in your best work!</span></p></div></div>
