With hundreds of thousands of Kailo patches sold, not one person in our clinical trial reported harmful *side effects.<br\/><br\/>To simplify the placement process, wait to apply the adhesive strip to your Kailo until after you have found the location on your body that provides the most pain reduction possible. In most cases, it will be somewhere between the pain and your brain.<br\/><br\/>As a general rule, start by placing your Kailo patch near (but above) your pain. Then, slowly move Kailo away from the pain and toward your brain, following the pathway of your nervous system.<br\/><br\/>If you start to feel Kailo warm up or tingle, you might have found a good location for your pain and you should stop in that location to see if your pain diminishes. Some customers only experience a decrease in pain without any warming or tingling. Kailo is designed to relieve pain in seconds. However, for some people, it can take longer, even a few minutes.<br\/><br\/>Never settle with the first point of relief. Test several areas on your body until you find the location that maximizes your pain relief or eliminates the pain completely.<br\/><br\/>If you are struggling to find the perfect placement position for your Kailo pain patch, don’t give up. Kailo is all about helping you find relief.
