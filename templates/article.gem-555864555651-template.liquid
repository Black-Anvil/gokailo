<p><a href="https://gokailo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an innovative, pain-relieving patch for patients looking for a safe, effective, and natural alternative to pharmaceutical pain relief. The Kailo pain patch is designed to boost the bodyâ€™s natural signals and may provide relief to a variety of patients with many limiting pain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although originating from different sources, both chronic and acute pain can affect your quality of life in surprising ways, both mentally and </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain"><span style="font-weight: 400;">physically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kailo pain patch may help alleviate bothersome pain symptoms caused by acute pain from surgery, broken bones due to accidents, and high-impact sports. The Kailo pain patch can be worn anywhere on the body, helping to potentially relax strained and tired muscles that can limit the ability to move and walk around comfortably throughout your daily home or work routine and slow down recovery times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easy-to-use Kailo pain patch uses state-of-the-art nanotechnology and may be worn to help the body naturally alleviate many types of chronic pain symptoms. Patients with chronic pain suffer from conditions such as migraines, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, lupus, endometriosis, cancer, and other medical conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic pain affects </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6736a2.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adults in the US and is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care. In addition, acute pain from injuries, surgeries, and high-impact sports contribute to productivity loss and higher healthcare costs for individuals, families, and their employers. The Kailo pain patch works to help turn off pain receptors naturally, which may, in turn, bring back a higher quality of life for patients dealing with all types of pain throughout the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who are pregnant and patients with pace-markers are advised to consult with their doctor before using the </span><a href="http://gokailo.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kailo pain-relieving patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></div></div>
