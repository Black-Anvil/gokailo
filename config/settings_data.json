If you believe that your order has cleared customs and has not yet been delivered, please check with your local post office to see if the package is being held there. Customs and duties are the responsibility of the buyer. We have no control over how long it takes for international orders to arrive. Please note that many international orders will be routed through a country other than that of its final destination. This is normal and is done to ensure a more secure delivery internationally."

Make sure the two pieces are directly on top of each other. Lift half of the adhesive and pull off the paper starting in the middle, as you are doing this flatten the adhesive side down onto the smooth side of the Kailo patch.  Repeat this step with the other half of the paper. Now your adhesive should be attached to your Kailo. Left on top is the clear plastic cover. You may want to keep this part so you have something to cover the adhesive with when it's not in use. That is the side you will attach to the spot on your body that you found relief.

The pain went away within seconds. I have been suffering from daily muscle spasms and tightening that was so painful. This would happen daily when I walked for more than a couple of minutes and when I would lie down to sleep. This has gone on for over 4 years . MRI’s , Xrays, chiropractor, massage therapy, orthopedist. I have tried everything and still ..pain. I know that your product isn’t fixing the issue, but it has (so far) given me amazing relief from the daily pain that I’ve been feeling. I have told several people about this product and I have no doubt that they will be ordering from you. Thank you so much for developing this amazing technology and delivering it at a reasonable price!!",
